## 🔎 Exercise 1.1 - Exploring the Code

For this exercise, spend some time familarising yourself with the code.
  
- Part of your journey to becoming a great Software Engineer
  is being able to read and understand code, as well as writing it.
- As children, we learn to read and speak in a language while we're learning how
  to write it; the same can be said about Software Engineering.

- 📖 So, flex those reading muscles! 💪

```
💡 Top Tip: Try looking at the README file first.
  Diagramming / sketching things out can be a handy way of
visualising a codebase that you haven't seen before. It can help you
  focus on the key information rather than getting lost in the details
  too soon.

<pre>

// Bit of a tricky one because we utilise the spyOn 
// Jest function to stub the return of 0.2
// Stub to calls to Math.random to return 0.2
jest.spyOn(global.Math, 'random').mockReturnValue(0.2);
